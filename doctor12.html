The Twelvth Doctor is an incarnation of the Doctor, the protagonist of the long-running BBC television science fiction programme Doctor Who. He is portrayed by Scottish actor Peter Capaldi.[1] Within the series' narrative, the Doctor is a time travelling, humanoid alien from a race known as the Time Lords. When the Doctor is critically injured, he can regenerate his body, and in doing so gain a new physical appearance, and with it a distinct new personality; this plot mechanism has allowed the Doctor to be portrayed by a series of actors over the decades since the programme's inception in 1963.

Capaldi made his first, very brief appearance as the Doctor in the show's fiftieth anniversary special "The Day of the Doctor" (2013), as one of the thirteen incarnations of the Doctor who are summoned to save Gallifrey from destruction. Capaldi's first full appearance was at the end of the Christmas special "The Time of the Doctor".[2][3] He will be accompanied in the eighth series by incumbent companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman).
